#     summary: A project to consolidate some tools Middleware offers for managing resources.
#     description: |
#       The Middleware CLI is an officially supported command line interface for Middleware, released as part of the Developer Toolkit.

#     # A guardrail to prevent you from releasing a snap to all your users before
#     # it is ready.
#     # `devel` will let you release only to the `edge` and `beta` channels in the
#     # store. `stable` will let you release also to the `candidate` and `stable`
#     # channels. More info about channels here:
#     # https://snapcraft.io/docs/reference/channels
#     grade: stable
#     confinement: strict
#     license: Apache-2.0
#     base: core18
#     apps:
#       # The name of the app must be the same name as the binary built or the snapcraft name.
#       middleware-cli:
#         # If your app requires extra permissions to work outside of its default
#         # confined space, declare them here.
#         # You can read the documentation about the available plugs and the
#         # things they allow:
#         # https://snapcraft.io/docs/reference/interfaces.
